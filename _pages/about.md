Welcome to my personal page!

I am a geneticist/entomologist, specialized in bioinformatics, population genomics, and data visualization. I am interested in studying evolution. 

I am currently a post-doc at Laval University in Quebec, Canada. I completed my PhD at Laval University with Ilga Porth.
