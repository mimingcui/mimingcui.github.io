Welcome to my personal space!

I am currently a post-doc with Ilga Porth and Damase Khasa at Laval University in Quebec, Canada.

I have developed a strong interest in using genomic tools to explain questions about evolution. I have a background in population genetics, landscape genomics, bioinformatics, molecular ecology, entomology, and invasion biology. I hope to contribute to explaining the complex series of problems regarding how life evolves.
