I am currently a post-doc at Laval University, working with [Ilga Porth](https://www.ibis.ulaval.ca/en/research/ilga-porth/)(PhD supervisor) and [Damase Khasa](https://www.ffgg.ulaval.ca/departements/sbf/professeurs/damase-p-khasa) on the GENOSCAN project, which aims to investigate the impacts of mining sites on local ecosystems in Northern Canada, focusing on the genetic indices of black spruce and microbiomes.

I have developed a strong interest in using genomic tools to explain questions about evolution. I have a background in population genetics, landscape genomics, bioinformatics, molecular ecology, entomology, and invasion biology. I hope to contribute to explaining the complex series of problems regarding how life evolves.
