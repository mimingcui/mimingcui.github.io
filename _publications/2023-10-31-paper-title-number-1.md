This publication is my doctoral thesis, which is to use genomic methods to study population genetics of an invasive insect species. It consists of three chapters, which is of the objective 1) to examine native population structure of A. glabripennis, ALB; 2) to study local adaptation of ALB populations; 3) to determine the invasion source(s) and reconstruct its invasion history in North America
